Dynamic 3D Printing assembles an arbitrary three-dimensional shape from a large number of small physical elements. It can also disassemble the shape back to elements and reconstruct a new shape. Dynamic 3D Printing combines the capabilities of 3D printers and shape displays: Like conventional 3D printing, it can generate arbi- trary and graspable three-dimensional shapes, while allowing shapes to be rapidly formed and reformed as in a shape display. To demonstrate the idea, we describe the design and imple- mentation of Dynablock, a working prototype of a dynamic 3D printer. Dynablock can form a three-dimensional shape in seconds by assembling 3,000 9 mm blocks, leveraging a 24 x 16 pin-based shape display as a parallel assembler. Dynamic 3D printing is a step toward achieving our long term vision in which 3D printing becomes an interactive medium, rather than the means for fabrication that it is today. In this paper we explore possibilities for this vision by illustrating application scenarios that are difficult to achieve with conventional 3D printing or shape display systems.\n\n<video preload="metadata" autoPlay loop muted playsInline webkit-playsinline="">\n  <source src="/static/projects/dynablock/webm/top.webm" type="video/webm"></source>\n  <source src="/static/projects/dynablock/video/top.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>\n</video>\n\n<div class="figures ui two column grid">\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-1-1.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-1-1.jpg" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-1-2.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-1-2.jpg" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class="figures ui three column grid">\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-2-1.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-2-1.jpg" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-2-2.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-2-2.jpg" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-2-3.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-2-3.jpg" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n# Dynamic 3D Printing\n\nWhat if 3D printers could form a physical object in seconds? What if the object, once it is no longer needed, could quickly and easily be disassembled and reconstructed as a new object? Today’s 3D printers take hours to print objects, and output a single static object. However, we envision a future in which 3D printing could instantly create objects from reusable and reconstructable materials.\n\nThis paper develops this vision by proposing Dynamic 3D Printing, a class of systems for rapid and reconstructable shape formation. Dynamic 3D Printing assembles digital material elements to form recon- structable physical objects. Each element can be connected with and disconnected from neighboring elements, and ele- ments can be formed into an arbitrary three-dimensional phys- ical object. Dynamic 3D printing differs from existing 3D printing in speed and reconstructability: Dynamic 3D printing forms shapes in seconds, rather than minutes. In addition, because individual elements can be disconnected, the shape can be easily disassembled into its basic building blocks once the object is no longer needed.\n\nWe define Dynamic 3D Printing as a class of systems that have the following properties:\n\n- Immediate: The system can form a physical shape in sec- onds.\n\n- Reconstructable: Rendered shapes can be disassembled and reconstructed by hand or with the system, and the blocks are reusable.\n\n- Arbitrary Shapes: It can create arbitrary three dimensional shapes.\n\n- Graspable: The output shapes and structure are graspable and solid.\n\n# Parallel Assembler\n\n<div class="figures ui one column grid">\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-3-1.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-3-1.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\nDynamic 3D printing deploys a large number of small dis- crete material elements, which are assembled to form arbitrary shaped macro-scale objects. Individual elements are passive, which requires an external actuator to perform the assembly. As illustrated in the above Figure, the assembler consists of an N x N grid of motorized pins and linear actuators. The elements, which are the same size as the pins, are stacked on top of the pins (Figure 3 A). When stacked, the elements are connected in vertical direction, while discon- nected with nearby elements in horizontal direction. Similar to existing pin-based shape displays, the assembler can incrementally generate 2.5D shapes by individually moving pins to push elements to the surface.\n\n<video preload="metadata" autoPlay loop muted playsInline webkit-playsinline="">\n  <source src="/static/projects/dynablock/webm/mechanism.webm" type="video/webm"></source>\n  <source src="/static/projects/dynablock/video/mechanism.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>\n</video>\n\n\n<div class="figures ui two column grid">\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-4-1.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-4-1.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <p class="column">\n    This paper develops this vision by proposing Dynamic 3D Printing, a class of systems for rapid and reconstructable shape formation.

Each pin moves up and down, driven by a small DC motor (TTMotors TGPP06-D700) and a 3D printed lead screw (2 mm pitch, 4 starts, 120 mm in length). TGPP06-D700 is 6 mm in diameter and 29 mm in length and can rotate 47 rpm with 1:700 gear ratio. The 2 mm 4 starts lead screw can travel 12 mm per second without load, and each motor consumes approximately 60 mA. The pins are 3D printed with a nut at the bottom to travel along the lead screw. Each pin is 120 mm long and has a 7mm square cross section with a 5 mm diameter hole from top to bottom, and an N45 disk magnet (φ 3mm x 2.4 mm thickness) is attached at the top. Guide grids at the top prevent pins from rotating and ensure that pins travel vertically. The 24 x 16 guide grids have 7.5 mm square holes with 10.16 mm pitch and are cut from a 5 mm acrylic plate. We fabricated the pins, the lead screws, and blocks with an inkjet 3D printer (Keyence Agilista 3200) with water soluble support material. In total, we fabricated 384 (= 24 x 16) pins and lead screws, and 3,072 (= 24 x 16 x 8 layers) blocks. To create the magnetic blocks, we embedded spherical magnets in each block by hand and inserted disk magnets using a bench vice.\n\n\n<div class="figures ui three column grid">\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-5-1.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-5-1.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-5-2.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-5-2.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-5-3.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-5-3.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class="figures ui three column grid">\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-7-1.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-7-1.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-7-2.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-7-2.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-7-3.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-7-3.jpg" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n# Future Vision\n\n<video preload="metadata" autoPlay loop muted playsInline webkit-playsinline="">\n  <source src="/static/projects/dynablock/webm/claytronics.webm" type="video/webm"></source>\n  <source src="/static/projects/dynablock/video/claytronics.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>\n</video>\n[Video Credit: Carnegie Mellon University, Claytronics Vision]\n\n<br/>\n\nWith these capabilities, a 3D printer would become an inter- active medium, rather than merely a fabrication device. For example, such a 3D printer could be used in a Virtual Real- ity or Augmented Reality application to dynamically form a tangible object or controller to provide haptic feedback and engage users physically. For children, it could dynamically form a physical educational manipulative, such as a molec- ular or architectural model, to learn and explore topics, for example in a science museum. Designers could use it to ren- der a physical product to present to clients and interactively change the product’s design through direct manipulation. In this vision, Dynamic 3D printing is an environment in which the user thinks, designs, explores, and communicates through dynamic and interactive physical representation.\n\n<div class="figures ui one column grid">\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-8-1.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-8-1.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\nDynamic 3D printing would enable a new design workflow for digital fabrication. One notable advantage of dynamic 3D printing is the capability of connecting and disconnecting building blocks through direct manipulation. The user can also define variables or abstract attributes for parametric design through direct and gestural interaction. By leveraging this capability, the user could interactively design and fabri- cate in a physical space, similar to the man-machine dialogue proposed by Frazer et al. and later tangible CAD interfaces.',bodyHtml:'\x3c!--\nLinks:\n[**[PDF](http://ryosuzuki.org/publications/uist-2018-dynablock.pdf)**]\n[**[ACM DL](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3242659)**]\n[**[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nPlr3O9xu8)**]\n[**[Slide](http://ryosuzuki.org/publications/uist-2018-dynablock-slide.pdf)**]\n[**[Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3FRUtOIiCQ)**]\n --\x3e\n<h1>Abstract</h1>\n<p>This paper introduces Dynamic 3D Printing, a fast and re- constructable shape formation system.

We fabricated the pins, the lead screws, and blocks with an inkjet 3D printer (Keyence Agilista 3200) with water soluble support material. In total, we fabricated 384 (= 24 x 16) pins and lead screws, and 3,072 (= 24 x 16 x 8 layers) blocks. To create the magnetic blocks, we embedded spherical magnets in each block by hand and inserted disk magnets using a bench vice.</p>\n<div class="figures ui three column grid">\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-5-1.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-5-1.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-5-2.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-5-2.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-5-3.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-5-3.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class="figures ui three column grid">\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-7-1.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-7-1.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-7-2.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-7-2.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-7-3.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/dynablock/figure-7-3.jpg" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h1>Future Vision</h1>\n<video preload="metadata" autoPlay loop muted playsInline webkit-playsinline="">\n  <source src="/static/projects/dynablock/webm/claytronics.webm" type="video/webm"></source>\n  <source src="/static/projects/dynablock/video/claytronics.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>\n</video>\n[Video Credit: Carnegie Mellon University, Claytronics Vision]\n<br/>\n<p>With these capabilities, a 3D printer would become an inter- active medium, rather than merely a fabrication device.

For children, it could dynamically form a physical educational manipulative, such as a molec- ular or architectural model, to learn and explore topics, for example in a science museum.

In such a workflow—compiling code on a digital screen then trans- ferring it into the physical object—users need to repeatedly switch between the digital and physical worlds. This leaves a large gulf of execution in their programming experiences.\nThus, the traditional programming paradigm significantly limits the user’s ability to experiment with the design of expressive motion. Moreover, due to this barrier, such an opportunity is largely limited to highly skilled programmers and researchers who are proficient in hardware programming.\n\n\n# MorphIO\n\nThis paper introduces **MorphIO, entirely soft sensing and actuation modules** for programming by demonstration of soft robots and shape-changing interfaces.\nMorphIO’s hardware consists of a soft pneumatic actuator containing a conductive sponge sensor. This allows for integrated and entirely soft shape-changing modules that can both sense and actuate a variety of three-dimensional deformations. Leveraging this capability, MorphIO enables the user to program behaviors by **recording and later playing back physical motions** through tangible interaction. In addition, the modular design of MorphIO’s unit allows the user to construct various shapes and topologies through magnetic connection, then **synthesize multiple recorded motions to achieve more complex behaviors**, such as bending, gripping, and walking.\n\n\n<video poster="/static/projects/morphio/video-poster/module.png" preload="metadata" autoplay loop muted playsinline webkit-playsinline="">\n  <source src="/static/projects/morphio/webm/module.webm" type="video/webm"></source>\n  <source src="/static/projects/morphio/video/module.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>\n</video>\n\n<br/>\n\n<video poster="/static/projects/morphio/video-poster/bear.png" preload="metadata" autoplay loop muted playsinline webkit-playsinline="">\n  <source src="/static/projects/morphio/webm/bear.webm" type="video/webm"></source>\n  <source src="/static/projects/morphio/video/bear.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>\n</video>\n\n\n# System Overview\n\nThe programming workflow with MorphIO is the following:\n\n- **Step 1:** A user starts manipulating the MorphIO unit.\n\n- **Step 2:** The demonstrated motion is detected and recorded through internal sensors, and the recorded sensor values are stored in the software.\n\n- **Step 3:** Once the user clicks play in the graphical user interface, the pneumatic pump starts supplying air.\n\n- **Step 4:** By controlling the air flow through switching on and off the solenoid valves, the system can control the behavior of the pneumatic actuator as it plays back the recorded motion.\n\nThe MorphIO system consists of the following components: A sensor and actuation unit, a sensing and actuation control unit, a microcontroller, software to control these units, and a visual interface for users to control behaviors. Figure illustrates the overview architecture of MorphIO.\n\n<div class="figures ui two column grid">\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/morphio/figure-6-1.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/morphio/figure-6-1.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/morphio/figure-6-2.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/morphio/figure-6-2.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n# Entirely Soft Sensing and Actuation Modules\n\nOur main contribution is a design and fabrication method for **a conductive sponge sensor** that can be embedded into an air chamber in the pneumatic actuator. The conductive sponge sensor leverages the porous structure to **sense the three-dimensional deformation by measuring the internal resistance value**; when contracted, the resistance value be- tween the top and bottom surfaces drops, and when extended, it increases. In contrast to existing sensing techniques, an elastic sponge allows for a higher degree of freedom in sensing capability (e.g., stretching, bending, and compression) without sacrificing the softness of the interface.\n\n<div class="figures ui two column grid">\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/morphio/figure-2-1.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/morphio/figure-2-1.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/morphio/figure-2-2.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/morphio/figure-2-2.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<video poster="/static/projects/morphio/video-poster/mechanism.png" preload="metadata" autoplay loop muted playsinline webkit-playsinline="">\n  <source src="/static/projects/morphio/webm/mechanism.webm" type="video/webm"></source>\n  <source src="/static/projects/morphio/video/mechanism.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>\n</video>\n\n\n<br />\n\nMoreover, our **modular design** and **graphical interface** allows for easy experiments involving multiple units. For example, the system can visualize multiple recorded sensor values, so that the user can see, customize, and synthesize recorded motion to construct more complex behaviors. These hardware and software designs were informed by our formative study, wherein we interviewed five experienced researchers from the robotics and HCI communities.\n\n\n<div class="figures ui two column grid">\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/morphio/figure-3-1.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/morphio/figure-3-1.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/morphio/figure-3-2.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/morphio/figure-3-2.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<video poster="/static/projects/morphio/video-poster/unit-x2.png" preload="metadata" autoplay loop muted playsinline webkit-playsinline="">\n  <source src="/static/projects/morphio/webm/unit-x2.webm" type="video/webm"></source>\n  <source src="/static/projects/morphio/video/unit-x2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>\n</video>\n\n<video poster="/static/projects/morphio/video-poster/unit-x3.png" preload="metadata" autoplay loop muted playsinline webkit-playsinline="">\n  <source src="/static/projects/morphio/webm/unit-x3.webm" type="video/webm"></source>\n  <source src="/static/projects/morphio/video/unit-x3.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>\n</video>\n\n\n<div class="figures ui one column grid">\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/morphio/figure-4-1.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/morphio/figure-4-1.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/morphio/figure-4-2.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/morphio/figure-4-2.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/morphio/figure-4-3.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/morphio/figure-4-3.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n# Fabrication Process\n\nThe fabrication process follows three steps: 1) Fabricate an elastic sponge, 2) impregnate into conductive ink, and 3) attach electrodes and wires.\nTo fabricate an elastic sponge, we first prepare 6.0 g of elastomer prepolymer solution and 29.1 g of sodium-chloride, then mix them together by using a planetary centrifugal mixer. The mixed solution is injected into a 3D printed cylindrical mold (16mm diameter, 40mm height). Then we dry the material with an oven at 100 C degrees for one hour.

We chose Arduino IDE (right) as a base condition for the comparison, as this is the most common programming approach identified through our formative study. We provide three basic tasks to construct a program. For each task, the participants were asked to program three differ- ent emotions—happiness, anger, and sadness—of an animated character.

When asked about the achievement of the expressions using a 9-point Likert scale, the average score with MorphIO was 6.5, compared to 6.3 with the control condition. We did not find differences between the two conditions.

In such a workflow—compiling code on a digital screen then trans- ferring it into the physical object—users need to repeatedly switch between the digital and physical worlds. This leaves a large gulf of execution in their programming experiences.\nThus, the traditional programming paradigm significantly limits the user’s ability to experiment with the design of expressive motion. Moreover, due to this barrier, such an opportunity is largely limited to highly skilled programmers and researchers who are proficient in hardware programming.</p>\n<h1>MorphIO</h1>\n<p>This paper introduces <strong>MorphIO, entirely soft sensing and actuation modules</strong> for programming by demonstration of soft robots and shape-changing interfaces.\nMorphIO’s hardware consists of a soft pneumatic actuator containing a conductive sponge sensor. This allows for integrated and entirely soft shape-changing modules that can both sense and actuate a variety of three-dimensional deformations. Leveraging this capability, MorphIO enables the user to program behaviors by <strong>recording and later playing back physical motions</strong> through tangible interaction. In addition, the modular design of MorphIO’s unit allows the user to construct various shapes and topologies through magnetic connection, then <strong>synthesize multiple recorded motions to achieve more complex behaviors</strong>, such as bending, gripping, and walking.</p>\n<video poster="/static/projects/morphio/video-poster/module.png" preload="metadata" autoplay loop muted playsinline webkit-playsinline="">\n  <source src="/static/projects/morphio/webm/module.webm" type="video/webm"></source>\n  <source src="/static/projects/morphio/video/module.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>\n</video>\n<br/>\n<video poster="/static/projects/morphio/video-poster/bear.png" preload="metadata" autoplay loop muted playsinline webkit-playsinline="">\n  <source src="/static/projects/morphio/webm/bear.webm" type="video/webm"></source>\n  <source src="/static/projects/morphio/video/bear.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>\n</video>\n<h1>System Overview</h1>\n<p>The programming workflow with MorphIO is the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> A user starts manipulating the MorphIO unit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The demonstrated motion is detected and recorded through internal sensors, and the recorded sensor values are stored in the software.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the user clicks play in the graphical user interface, the pneumatic pump starts supplying air.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> By controlling the air flow through switching on and off the solenoid valves, the system can control the behavior of the pneumatic actuator as it plays back the recorded motion.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The MorphIO system consists of the following components: A sensor and actuation unit, a sensing and actuation control unit, a microcontroller, software to control these units, and a visual interface for users to control behaviors.

The conductive sponge sensor leverages the porous structure to <strong>sense the three-dimensional deformation by measuring the internal resistance value</strong>; when contracted, the resistance value be- tween the top and bottom surfaces drops, and when extended, it increases. In contrast to existing sensing techniques, an elastic sponge allows for a higher degree of freedom in sensing capability (e.g., stretching, bending, and compression) without sacrificing the softness of the interface.</p>\n<div class="figures ui two column grid">\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/morphio/figure-2-1.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/morphio/figure-2-1.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/morphio/figure-2-2.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/morphio/figure-2-2.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<video poster="/static/projects/morphio/video-poster/mechanism.png" preload="metadata" autoplay loop muted playsinline webkit-playsinline="">\n  <source src="/static/projects/morphio/webm/mechanism.webm" type="video/webm"></source>\n  <source src="/static/projects/morphio/video/mechanism.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>\n</video>\n<br />\n<p>Moreover, our <strong>modular design</strong> and <strong>graphical interface</strong> allows for easy experiments involving multiple units.

While the idea of coordinated miniature robots was originally proposed in the literature of swarm and micro-robotic systems, HCI researchers have explored the use of these robots as a user interface.\nHowever, this opportunity is currently limited to highly skilled programmers who are proficient in robot programming. For typical programmers inexperienced in robot programming who wish to build a Swarm UI application, it is unclear if the robot programming approach is the most appropriate for UI programming. To design interactive UI applications, pro- grammers often must think in terms of higher-level design for user interaction, whereas robot programming tends to focus on low-level controls of sensors and actuators. Historically, a novel UI platform is adopted only after the advent of an effective programming tool that empowers a larger developer community, and even end-users, to create many applications for the platform; for example, HyperCard for interactive hyper- media, Phidgets for physical interfaces, and Interface Builder for GUI applications. We stipulate that current approaches to programming Swarm UI are too robot-centric to be effec- tive for building rich and interactive applications. Then, what would be a better alternative?\n\n\n# Reactile\n\nThis paper introduces Reactile, a programming environment for Swarm UI applications.\nThe goal of Reactile is to explore a new approach to programming Swarm UI applications. To design an appropriate workflow for Swarm UI programming, we look into existing UI programming paradigm for inspiration. The common workflow of UI programming can be decomposed into four basic steps: create elements, abstract attributes, specify behaviors, and propagate changes. Based on these insights, we propose the following four-step workflow for Swarm UI programming: 1) creates shapes, 2) abstracts shape attributes as variables, 3) specifies data-bindings be- tween dynamic attributes, and 4) the system changes shapes in response to user inputs. With this workflow, a programmer can think in terms of high-level interface and interaction design to build interactive Swarm UI appli- cations, compared to existing, low-level, robot programming approaches.\n\n\n<div class="figures ui one column grid">\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/reactile/figure-3.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/reactile/figure-3.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\nThe workflow of Swarm UI programming is inspired by the existing UI programming paradigm. We first review the common workflow of UI programming and decompose it into four basic elements that represent high-level steps. Then we discuss how to apply this workflow to Swarm UI programming.\nAs we see in well-known design patterns for interactive UI ap- plications such as reactive programming paradigm, the Model-View-Controller, and the observer pattern, they share a com- mon workflow consisting of four basic elements: 1) create elements, 2) abstract attributes, 3) specify behaviors, and 4) propagate changes.\n\n\n<div class="figures ui three column grid">\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/reactile/figure-1-4.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/reactile/figure-1-4.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/reactile/figure-1-5.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/reactile/figure-1-5.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/reactile/figure-1-6.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/reactile/figure-1-6.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class="figures ui three column grid">\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/reactile/figure-2-4.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/reactile/figure-2-4.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/reactile/figure-2-5.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/reactile/figure-2-5.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/reactile/figure-2-6.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/reactile/figure-2-6.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n# Implementation\n\nReactile actuates a swarm of small magnetic markers to move on a 2D canvas with electromagnetic force. We designed and fabricated a board of electromagnetic coil arrays (3,200 coils), which covers an 80 cm x 40 cm area. Reactile tracks the marker positions and detects interactions between a user and swarm markers using a standard RGB camera and computer vision techniques. The system displays spatial information using a DLP projector to allow a programmer to see program states in the same physical context.\n\n<video preload="metadata" autoPlay loop muted playsInline webkit-playsinline="">\n  <source src="/static/projects/reactile/coil.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>\n</video>\n\n<br />\n\nIn Reactile, a user interface consists of a swarm of passive magnetic markers which move on a 2D workspace driven by electromagnetic forces. Reactile uses a grid of electromagnetic coils to actuate these magnetic markers. Running current through the circuit coils generates a local magnetic field so that each coil can attract a single magnet located within its area. Each coil is aligned with a certain offset in both horizontal and vertical direction with an effective area overlap, which allows the coil to attract the magnet located in the adjacent coil. We design electromagnetic coil arrays to be fabricated with a standard printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing. This reduces the cost and fabrication complexity, making it easy for the actuation area to scale up.\n\nOur PCB design is a 4-layer board, and each layer contains a set of coils, each of which has an identical circular shape with a 15 mm diameter and a 2.5 mm overlap between nearby coils. Each coil has 15 turns with 0.203 mm (8 mils) spacing between lines, and the distance between centers of two coils is approximately 10 mm, which makes a 10 mm grid for attractive points. The final prototype covers an 80 cm x 40 cm area with 80 x 40 coils by aligning five identical boards horizontally. The fabrication of each board costs approximately $80 USD, including manufacturing of PCB and electronic components.\n\n<br />\n\n\n<video preload="metadata" autoPlay loop muted playsInline webkit-playsinline="">\n  <source src="/static/projects/reactile/mechanism.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>\n</video>',bodyHtml:'<h1>Abstract</h1>\n<p>We explore a new approach to programming swarm user interfaces (Swarm UI) by leveraging direct physical manipulation.

A swarm of self-transformable robots can both individually and collectively change their configuration to display information, actuate objects, act as tangible controllers, visualize data, and provide physical affordances. ShapeBots is a concept prototype of shape-changing swarm robots. Each robot can change its shape by leveraging small linear actuators that are thin (2.5 cm) and highly extendable (up to 20cm) in both horizontal and vertical directions. The modular design of each actuator enables various shapes and geometries of self-transformation. We illustrate potential application scenarios and discuss how this type of interface opens up possibilities for the future of ubiquitous and distributed shape-changing interfaces.\n\n<video preload="metadata" autoPlay loop muted playsInline webkit-playsinline="">\n  <source src="/static/projects/shapebots/video/top.webm" type="video/webm"></source>\n  <source src="/static/projects/shapebots/video/top.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>\n</video>\n\n\n<div class="figures ui two column grid">\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-1-2.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-1-2.jpg" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-1-1.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-1-1.jpg" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class="figures ui three column grid">\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-2-1.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-2-1.jpg" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-2-2.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-2-2.jpg" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-2-3.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-2-3.jpg" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n# Shape-changing Swarm Robots\n\nThis paper introduces **shape-changing swarm robots** for dis- tributed shape-changing interfaces.

To enable a large deformation capability of tiny swarm robots, we developed a miniature reel-based linear actuator that is thin (2.5 cm) and fits into the small footprint (3 cm x 3 cm), while able to extend up to 20 cm in both horizontal and vertical directions.\n\n<video preload="metadata" autoPlay loop muted playsInline webkit-playsinline="">\n  <source src="/static/projects/shapebots/video/unit.webm" type="video/webm"></source>\n  <source src="/static/projects/shapebots/video/unit.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>\n</video>\n\n<div class="figures ui two column grid">\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-5-1.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-5-1.jpg" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-5-2.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-5-2.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class="figures ui two column grid">\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-6-1.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-6-1.jpg" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-6-2.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-6-2.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\nThe modular design of each linear actuator unit enables the construction of various shapes and geometries of individual shape transformation (e.g., horizontal lines, vertical lines, curved lines, 2D area expan- sion, and 3D volumetric change). Based on these capabilities, we demonstrate application scenarios showing how a swarm of distributed self-transformable robots can support everyday interactions.\n\n<video preload="metadata" autoPlay loop muted playsInline webkit-playsinline="">\n  <source src="/static/projects/shapebots/video/transformation.webm" type="video/webm"></source>\n  <source src="/static/projects/shapebots/video/transformation.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>\n</video>\n\n\n# Tracking and Control\n\nTo track the position and orientation of the swarm robots, we used computer vision and a fiducial marker attached to the bottom of the robot. We used the ArUco fiducial marker printed on a sheet of paper and taped to the bottom of the robot. Our prototype used a 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm size marker with a 4 x 4 grid pattern, which can provide up to 50 unique patterns. For tracking software, we used the OpenCV library and ArUco python module. It can track the position of the markers at 60 frames per second.\n\n<video preload="metadata" autoPlay loop muted playsInline webkit-playsinline="">\n  <source src="/static/projects/shapebots/video/tracking.webm" type="video/webm"></source>\n  <source src="/static/projects/shapebots/video/tracking.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>\n</video>\n\n<div class="figures ui three column grid">\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-7-1.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-7-1.jpg" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-7-2.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-7-2.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-7-3.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-7-3.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\nTo enable the user to easily specify a target shape, we created a web-based interface where users draw a shape or upload an SVG image (Figure 10). The user draws a set of lines, then the main computer calculates target positions, orientations, and actuator lengths to start sending commands.\n\n<div class="figures ui one column grid">\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-8.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-8.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\nWe can use the same mechanism to track user input. The system supports four different types of user interaction that our system supports: place, move, orient, and pick-up.\nThe system recognizes as user inputs movement or rotation of a marker that it did not generate.\n\n\n\n# Applications: Robots as Dynamic Physical Media\nWe explore potential application scenarios for the future of human-robot interactions.\nOne interesting application area is to use these **robots as dynamic physical media**, such as showing **data visualization in the physical world**.\nFor example, ShapeBots on the USA map physicalize map data; each robot changes its height to show the population of the state it is on. Users can interact with the dataset by placing a new robot or moving a robot to a different state, and the robots update their physical forms to represent the respective population.\n\n<video preload="metadata" autoPlay loop muted playsInline webkit-playsinline="">\n  <source src="/static/projects/shapebots/video/dataphys.webm" type="video/webm"></source>\n  <source src="/static/projects/shapebots/video/dataphys.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>\n</video>\n\n<div class="figures ui three column grid">\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-9-1.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-9-1.jpg" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-9-2.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-9-2.jpg" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-9-3.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-9-3.jpg" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\nSimilarly, ShapeBots can provide a physical preview of a CAD design. ShapeBots physicalizes the actual size of the box. The design and physical rendering are tightly coupled; as the user changes the height of the box in CAD software, the ShapeBots change heights accordingly. The user can change the parameters of the design by moving robots in the physical space, and these changes are reflected in the CAD design.\n\n<video preload="metadata" autoPlay loop muted playsInline webkit-playsinline="">\n  <source src="/static/projects/shapebots/video/cad.webm" type="video/webm"></source>\n  <source src="/static/projects/shapebots/video/cad.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>\n</video>\n\n\n<div class="figures ui three column grid">\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-9-4.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-9-4.jpg" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-9-5.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-9-5.jpg" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-9-6.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-9-6.jpg" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n# Applications: Robots as Ambient Assistants\n\nAnother practical aspect of ShapeBots is the ability to actuate objects and act as physical constraints.

For example, when the user pours hot coffee into a cup, the robots surround the cup and change their heights to create a vertical fence. The vertical fence visually and physically provides the affordance to indicate that the coffee is too hot and not ready to drink. Once it is ready, the robots start dispersing and allow the user to grab it. These scenarios illustrate how the distributed shape-changing robots can provide a new type of affordance, which we call **distributed dynamic physical affordances**.\n\n<video preload="metadata" autoPlay loop muted playsInline webkit-playsinline="">\n  <source src="/static/projects/shapebots/video/affordance.webm" type="video/webm"></source>\n  <source src="/static/projects/shapebots/video/affordance.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>\n</video>\n\n\n<div class="figures ui three column grid">\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-10-1.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-10-1.jpg" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-10-2.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-10-2.jpg" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-10-3.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-10-3.jpg" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\nShapeBots can also act as an interactive physical display.

A swarm of self-transformable robots can both individually and collectively change their configuration to display information, actuate objects, act as tangible controllers, visualize data, and provide physical affordances. ShapeBots is a concept prototype of shape-changing swarm robots. Each robot can change its shape by leveraging small linear actuators that are thin (2.5 cm) and highly extendable (up to 20cm) in both horizontal and vertical directions. The modular design of each actuator enables various shapes and geometries of self-transformation.

You can also play with the <a href="https://ryosuzuki.github.io/shapebots-simulator/"><strong>explorable online simulator</strong></a> to see how these robots can render the shape ↓</p>\n<video preload="metadata" autoPlay loop muted playsInline webkit-playsinline="">\n  <source src="/static/projects/shapebots/video/explorable.webm" type="video/webm"></source>\n  <source src="/static/projects/shapebots/video/explorable.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>\n</video>\n<h1>Future Work</h1>\n<p>ShapeBots is just a single example of shape-changing swarm robots.\nThere is a broader design space of shape- changing swarm user interfaces.\nAs future work, we are interested in exploring the different aspct of shape-changing swarm robots.</p>\n<div class="figures ui one column grid">\n  <div class="figure column">\n    <a href="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-12.png" data-lightbox="lightbox"><img src="/static/projects/shapebots/figure-12.png" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\x3c!--\n# Appendix\n\n<video preload="metadata" autoPlay loop muted playsInline webkit-playsinline="">\n  <source src="/static/projects/shapebots/video/fabrication.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>\n</video>\n\n\n<video preload="metadata" autoPlay loop muted playsInline webkit-playsinline="">\n  <source src="/static/projects/shapebots/video/explorable.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>\n</video>\n --\x3e',dir:"content/output/projects",base:"shapebots.json",ext:".json",sourceBase:"shapebots.md",sourceExt:".md"}},mRot:function(e){e.exports={id:"refazer",name:"Refazer",description:"Learning Syntactic Program Transformations from Examples",title:"Learning Syntactic Program Transformations from Examples",authors:["Reudismam Rolim","Gustavo Soares","Loris D'Antoni","Oleksandr Polozov","Sumit Gulwani","Rohit Gheyi","Ryo Suzuki","Björn Hartmann"],yera:2017,booktitle:"In Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE '17)",publisher:"IEEE Press, Piscataway, NJ, USA",pages:"404-415",conference:{name:"ICSE 2017",fullname:"The International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2017)",url:"http://icse2017.gatech.edu/"},pdf:"icse-2017-refazer.pdf","acm-dl":"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3097417",arxiv:"https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.09000",pageCount:12,slideCount:0,image:"refazer.png",bodyContent:"",bodyHtml:"",dir:"content/output/projects",base:"refazer.json",ext:".json",sourceBase:"refazer.md",sourceExt:".md"}},nWAr:function(e){e.exports={id:"atelier",name:"Atelier",description:"Repurposing Expert Crowdsourcing Tasks as Micro-internships",title:"Atelier: Repurposing Expert Crowdsourcing Tasks as Micro-internships",authors:["Ryo Suzuki","Niloufar Salehi","Michelle S.
